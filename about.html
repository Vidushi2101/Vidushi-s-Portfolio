        <h2>Hello, I'm Vidushi Vani</h2>
        <p>A dynamic and enthusiastic computer science student currently pursuing my degree
            at SRM UNIVERSITY. Fueled by a passion for technology and innovation, I embark on a journey to
            explore the vast realm of computer science.</p>
        <p>My academic pursuits delve into diverse aspects, from algorithms and data structures to software engineering
            and artificial intelligence. Constantly honing my coding skills, I find joy in solving complex problems and
            turning ideas into functional, elegant solutions.

            Beyond the code, I actively engage in the vibrant college community, participating in hackathons, coding
            competitions, and collaborative projects. As a tech enthusiast, I strive to stay abreast of the latest
            industry trends and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

            Eager to blend theoretical knowledge with hands-on experiences, I seek opportunities to intern, collaborate
            on innovative projects, and immerse myself in the practical applications of computer science.

            In essence, I am a forward-thinking individual on a mission to leverage the power of code to shape a future
            where technology is a force for positive change.

            Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities that the world of computer science has to offer! ðŸš€
